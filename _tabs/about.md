My name is Adam de Leeuw, and I am a technical specialist at IBM UK.  For many years I have assisted business partners to embed IBM technology in their solutions.  This blog documents my experience with technologies relevant to this mission, for example Red Hat OpenShift and embeddable AI.

Please keep in mind that all opinions expressed on this blog are my own personal views and may not reflect those of IBM.
